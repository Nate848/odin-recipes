        <p>I was going to use the recipe my grandmother uses to make my favorite dish when I visit her. Unfortunately, however, I have misplaced that recipe. Instead, here is a taco casserole recipe with a few additional comments of my own that I have retrieved from <a href="https://princesspinkygirl.com/easy-taco-bake-casserole/">this link</a> so that I can practice my website building skills with the little bit of HTML I have learned so far!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 Pounds of Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
            <li>4 Softshell flour (or corn) tortillas</li>
            <li>1 package of taco seasoning mix (be sure to also have the water that the taco seasoning package requires)</li>
            <li>2 Cups of Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>1 10-oz can of Rotal</li>
            <li>1 2.25-ox can of sliced black olives (this can be skipped if you, like me, are not a fan of olives!)</li>
            <li>1 15-oz can of corn</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>The Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have not yet done so, gather all of the ingredients listed above!</li>
            <li>Brown the ground beef and onions until the ground beef is no longer pink, and the onions are tender.</li>
            <li>Mix the taco seasoning and the required amount of water for the seasoning into the meat, and cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rotel, olives (if you choose to add olives), and corn into the beef mixture, and let simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are using a glass pan, choose a 9x13 inch dish or one of similar size, and spray it with a non-stick spray. <em>If you choose to use stoneware, do <strong>not</strong> spray nonstick spray onto your pan!</em></li>
            <li>Place two of your tortillas on the bottom of the dish, and spread half of the meat mix evenly on top of the layer of tortillas.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the cheese over the meat.</li>
            <li>Follow the last two steps again, so that, from the bottom, you have a layer of tortilla, a layer of meat, a layer of cheese, another layer of torilla, a second layer of meat, and a second layer of cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees until the cheese is melted. This will likely take about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove your dish from the oven! It is best to let it cool for a few minutes, and then serve the dish with your favorite taco toppings! My own family typically loves to add corn chips, sour cream, extra cheese, and diced onions on top!
