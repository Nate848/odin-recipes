        <p>This is a third recipe that I am using to practice building an html page for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project!</a> The recipe I am using is not my own, and is retrieved from <a href="https://www.shugarysweets.com/bakery-style-brownies/">The Shugary Sweets website</a> on 3 January 2023!</p>
    <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <1i>1 tsp vanilla extract</1i>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>The Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While the oven is preheating, prepare a 9-inch square baking dish by lining it with parchment paper or by spraying it with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted, remove the saucepan from heat, and mix in the chocolate chips and sugar. Stir until the chocolate is fully melted.</li>
            <li>Next, add in the eggs one at a time, stirring well after each egg is added.</li>
            <li>Mix in the vanilla, cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir until the batter is fully mixed, and there are no clumps of dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the dish you prepared in step one, and bake for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>After baking, remove the brownies from the oven, and let them cool well before cutting. They should be a fudgy brownie consistency.</li>
        </ol>
